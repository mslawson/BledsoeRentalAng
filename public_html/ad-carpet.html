                                            <ol><li>Windsor Carpet Extractor $28 3/hr or $34 a Day</li>
                                            <li>Suprox Concentrate 1 Gallon $34.99</li>
                                            <li>Carpet Pre-Spray 1 Quart $15.99</li>

                                            </ol><p style="padding-bottom: 75px;"></p>
                                      
                                      <p><h2>For Average Soiled Areas:</h2></p>
<ol><li>Dilute the Suprox Concentrate 3 oz. Per gallon or 1 part to 40 parts water in solution tank of extractor.</li>
<li>While applying solution,  and brush on and vacuum off, go over area to be cleaned in one direction.  This will give the chemical time to work most effectively and agitate the solution into the carpet fibers.</li>
<li>Drain Tank and refill with clean water and a packet of Carpet PH Rinse and go over the carpet in the opposite direction while applying solution, with brush and vacuum on.  Before beginning this step you will use the provided Defoamer spray bottle to treat the Carpet Cleaning Machine.  Simply spray inside the recover hose and inside the tank with Defoamer before extracting.  (If you are operating a model that does not allow you to spray the inside of the recovery hose, simply spray your recovery tank, and spray multiple sprays(5-7) of Defoamer on the carpet for the first five feet that you will make your first pass with.  Go over the carpet in the opposite direction while applying solution.  This time BOTH the brush and the vacuum should be on as you will be extracting the water in the carpet during this step.</li>
<li>Dry carpet using some type of air movement…fan, ceiling fan, etc.</li>
<li>Empty machine of any remaining cleaning solution and rinse out dirty water tank.</li></ol>
<p><h3 class="red">Note: 1 gallon of Suprox Concentrate makes 40 gallons of diluted product (at 3 oz per gallon of water), 40 gallons of diluted product will clean approximately 16,000 square feet.</h3></p>
